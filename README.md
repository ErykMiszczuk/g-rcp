# About
This is a raycast-based "realistic" car simulator which could be used for games involving vehicles in a realistic manner.

# Tip
For automatic shifting, Open ```car.gd``` from the ```main scripts``` folder then go to ```line 20``` (which is the GearAssistant variable) and set the second row of the array to 2.

# Help
There are comments within the scripts which may help. Further instructions on how to use will come soon. You might have to play around with it first.
